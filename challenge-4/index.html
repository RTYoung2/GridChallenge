                <p>The Boondocks is Aaron McGruders boundary-busting series based on his provocative comic strip. A
                    breakout hit on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim, it was nominated for a 2006 NAACPS image award. Join
                    Huey, a ten-year-old leftist revolutionary, and his eight-year-old misfit brother, Riley, as they
                    leave the rough Chicago south side for the relative peacefulness of the suburbs. Although the boys
                    torture each other and provoke the neighborhood, they are still no match for Granddad, who is
                    eccentric even by 'crazy-ass-old-black-man' standards. $47.84</p>

                <p>Ichigo Kurosaki is a 15-year-old-boy who has an ability to see ghosts/spirits. Because of his
                    ability, he is able to meet a female death god (AKA Shinigami) named Rukia Kuchiki. To save his
                    family and friends from unwanted soul-eating spirits (Hollows), Rukia transfers her Shinigami
                    powers
                    to Ichigo. As Rukia takes on a human shell, together they solve mysteries involving spirits and
                    Hollows until from the spirit world come two other Shinigami, who explain that it is illegal to
                    transfer Shinigami powers to humans and that Rukia exceeded the time limit to stay in the human
                    world. After they sentence her death for breaking the law, Ichigo snaps and swears to everyone
                    he
                    will retrieve Rukia by breaking into the spirit world. $88.00</p>

                <p>Hear his voice. Have his ear. Belong to his body.

                    Three seemingly unremarkable principles shape and strengthen the Christian life: listening to God’s
                    voice, speaking to him in prayer, and joining together with his people as the church. Though often
                    viewed as normal and routine, the everyday “habits of grace” we cultivate give us access to these
                    God-designed channels through which his love and power flow―including the greatest joy of all:
                    knowing and enjoying Jesus. $15.69</p>

                    Leonidas (Gerard Butler) and 300 Spartans fought to the death against Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) and
                    his massive Persian army. Experience history at swordpoint. And moviemaking with a cutting edge.
